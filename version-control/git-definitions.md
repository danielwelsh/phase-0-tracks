**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is software that tracks additions and deletions to work in a cronological manner. Therefore, a developer can use version control to keep a time-oriented history of software that they are working on. This can be useful when a developer makes additions that cause many bugs. Using version control the developer can simply revert to a previous version of their software that functions properly. The developer could even return to a version many "saves" old if that was desired. Version control allows the developer to access copies of software from all stages of its life. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch creates a seperate copy of the project that you are working on. Branching is very useful as it allows developers to collaborate together, work on seperate features, then merge the features back together when completed. 
 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a process where a developer saves a version of files that have been "added" to the staging area. Each commit is submited with a comment that describes what has been done during that commit period. It is best practice to write comments in present tense and summarize the work that was completed. Good comments will make it easier to identify commit versions when looking back through your log.

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts are errors that are made when merging files that have made changes to the same line. When this occurs the computer will not know how to properly merge the files together. Merge conflicts can also occur when someone deletes the file on the master branch and there is no file to merge to.

Here is a link to a page that explains how to fix and edit merge conflicts that may occur: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/.
