<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>HTML 5 semantic tags are used to add more specific meaning to a given peice of text. This can be used to assit browsers in reading the information. It is also useful in assiting those with disabilities to use and navigate the internet.</p>
<p>The browser will read the HTML from top to bottom. It will also read and complete the daughter information before moving to the next parents tags.</p>
<p>In this challenge we learnt that sublime can be personalized to meet the developers specific needs. When working in the future I can create my own snippets to ease the process of setting up documents. This can be especially useful to add all meta data tags that are needed to be used.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of this challenge was finding answers to my questions online. When looking for what else was missing in the basic html framework I found nothing that directly answered my question. Most of the time I can find clear explanations immediately. I believe this is becuase I did not know the keywords that were needed to find related articles. I should have spent more time with the questions and the release documentation to find these words that would assist my search.</p>
