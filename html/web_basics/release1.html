<h1>I Love Fast Cars!</h1>
<p>Car companies continue to push boundaries and make faster and faster street legal cars. Hybrid technology has meant cars now utilize the massive torque of <strong> electric motors </strong>  to drop 0-60 times significantly. </p>
<h3>A list of hybrid combustion-electic hyper cars:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Ferrari LaFerrari</li>
	<li>Mclaren P1</li>
	<li>Porsche 918</li>
</ul>
<p>These three cars are in competition to determine who has the fastest 0-60 time. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Porsche 918 Spyder: 2.3s</li>
	<li>Ferrari LaFerrari: 2.6s</li>
	<li>Mclaren P1: 2.7s</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_918_Spyder">Porsche 918</a> is very impressive and is the <em>fastest</em> of all the hyper cars.</p>
