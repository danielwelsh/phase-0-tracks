#Pseudocode for game word guessing game. 

#Create game class

#Create reader and getter variables


#Method- Guessing functions









#Driver Code

#The user is welcomed to the game

#User 1 is prompted to enter a word into the game
	#Have this blurred out like a password if possible


#User 2 enters into the guessing loop of the game. This is limited to the length of the word

	#User 2 is given the length of the word in order to help gauge what they are looking for

		#User 2 is asked if they would like to make a guess of a letter or a word
			#User 2 makes a guess of a word
				#If the word is correct they are told so and the game ends
				#Else if they are wrong they are looped back to give another guess
			#User 2 makes a guess of a letter
				#The letter is checked to be include in the word. 
					#If the letter is in word, fill in the blank
					#elsif the letter has already been guessed this will not count against the user. the loop should be broken to prevent the counter being added to. 
					#Else print a message that this letter was not included
